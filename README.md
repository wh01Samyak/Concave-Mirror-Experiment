# Concave-Mirror-Experiment
 
A 3d animation to show real and imaginary image formation using a concave mirror. 

--Image(real) is formed at infinity when object is placed on the focus. 

--Image(real) is formed beyond the focus when object is placed beyond the focus.

--Image(imaginary) is formed behind the mirror when object is placed before the focus.
  
--Real images (rays actually meet) can be cast on a screen, Imaginary (rays appear to meet) can only be seen on a mirror.
  
--It can also be seen that images can only be seen from some angle on the mirror and that images appear differently from different viewing angles.

--See the simulation @ https://wh01samyak.github.io/Concave-Mirror-Experiment/
